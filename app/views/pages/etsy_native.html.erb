                Etsy acquired Mixel&apos;s four-person design and development team on January 1, 2013, in order to shore up their tiny mobile team and to grow the presence of their native iPhone app. Over the years I&apos;ve taken this mission to heart, and even though native development at Etsy is no longer concentrated in a single mobile team, I continue to advocate for special native-focused projects. I believe this keeps us nimble and aids Etsy in many ways, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Growing and supporting our dedicated user base</li>
                <li>Generating a positive perception of Etsy&apos;s continued technology focus both internally and to investors</li>
                <li>Shepherding the relationship with our technology partners, both Google and Apple</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="border_top">EtsyKit</h2>
            <p>
                EtsyKit is an iOS framework and demo app for internal use that helps developers create Etsy styling. The framework's accompanying demo app demonstrates EtsyKit&apos;s capabilities.

                Before EtsyKit, the native apps were a hodgepodge of different visual elements and coding styles. This made both visual QA and development tedious and error prone. A staff engineer asked me to assist him in creating canonical patterns as well as design the demo app. Though this was not my main project at the time, I jumped at the chance. EtsyKit is now used in the development of all iOS features.

            <h2 class="border_top">Sell on Etsy</h2>
            <p>
                Sell on Etsy was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I&apos;ve worked on to date. Originally the forward-looking vision of a single developer, Jey, SoE was meant to create a streamlined process for new users to begin selling on Etsy though a standalone mobile app. Khoi Vinh asked me to go out to San Francisco and work with Jey to help him realize his vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                But problems quickly arose. While Jey&apos;s ideas were terrific in isolation, Etsy &ndash; already a bustling marketplace &ndash; used listings and shops that contain more structured data than the early conception of SoE would support. It seemed that if this version of the app launched the shops and listings it would produce would have too little data to succeed in the real marketplace. This flaw coupled with changes in management and the sea change caused by the introduction of iOS 7 made the launch of SoE seem like an impossibility.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Both Jey and I decided we weren't going to fail, and I resolved to convince Jey that we needed to change SoE in a fundamental way. I began talking to the VP of engineering, the director of mobile and my design manager trying to figure out how we could save the app. After a month or two of conversation we decided to re-cast the app as a set of seller tools for already established Etsy sellers. We invited Jey to NYC and had soon convinced him of the idea as well.

            </div>
            <p>
                We redesigned and developed the whole app in 3 months, removing onboarding but adding push notifications, a dashboard, stats, listing management, order screens, convos, reviews, and numerous settings screens. Having recreated most of Etsy's seller tools our team of six launched Sell on Etsy in early 2014. A different team followed up this release with an Android version just 2 months later. Sellers love SoE and report using it every day to manage their shops. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="border_top">In-Person Payments and the Etsy Card Reader</h2>
            <p>
                We knew that many of our sellers were using other payment solutions when selling in person, and this was causing them to create two sets of inventory &ndash; one in our system and one for whichever other system they were using for in-person sales. By creating our own card reader Etsy sellers would be able to use their Etsy inventory exclusively when selling in person. Fred Wilson writes about this idea and more <%= link_to "here", "http://avc.com/2014/10/feature-friday-etsy-in-real-life/" %>.

                Over the course of several months I designed software for both iOS and Android that would enable credit card swiping, manual entry, cash entry, discounts, and practice swiping. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, this was Etsy's first attempt at creating a physical product, and we treated the card reader as a special item by adding a locally sourced, reusable holder/base made from recycled materials. I advised for this part of project as well.

            <h2 class="border_top">Appreciation Photos</h2>
            <p>
                On Etsy transactions often start relationships between buyers and sellers. By provding a way for buyers to attach appreciation photos to 5 star reviews sellers could then see their hardwork in situ, and feel positive vibes from a happy buyer. Even better, if a buyer shared their photo on a social network it could spur more sales for the seller&apos;s shop. Moreover, we theorized that reviews with appreciation photos might sway new buyers that were on the fence to purchase a similar item.
            </p>
            <p>
                My team and I decided to create a native only experience that would take advantage of the camera on mobile phones to help satisfied buyers capture appreciation photos and attach them to 5 star reviews. After posting the review we then prompted the buyers to share their photos on social media &ndash reminding them that this could help the seller make more sales.
            </p>

            <div class="ap_stars_animation portfolio_image_container desktop">
                <%= image_tag "/images/portfolio/ap_stars.gif", alt: "#", class: 
                "left_gif" %>
                <%= image_tag "/images/portfolio/ap_add_photos.gif", alt: "#" %>

            </div>

            <p>
                The team improved the reviews flow while adding appreciation photos to reviews throughout the Etsy system (web, iOS, and Android). We also created landing pages for inbound traffic to shared AP links. I prototyped 3 animations including a star animation to promote tapping into reviews, an animation that displayed several illustrations of the right kinds of photos and a seperate animated popup that conveyed the value of sharing their appreciation photo on social media.
            </p>

            <div class="portfolio_image_container">

            </div>

            <p>
                The appreciation photos project was incredibly successful for Etsy. We increased the number of reviews submissions, and saw an increase in overall conversion for items with apperciation photos in their reviews. The percent of purchases that result in a review has also doubled. 10% of Android reviews now have a photo while 7% of iOS, and we're beyond half a million photos shared. Additionaly, there has been an uptick in visits from social media that can be attributed to shared photos.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                At Etsy our web toolkit, EtsyKit (iOS), and Android tools were all developed seperately which means fundamental styles like sizing and spacing vary from platform to platform. I used the appreciation photos project as a moment to experiment with aligning styles between platforms and toolkits. In particular I started using Graphik, a typeface recommended by our Brand Design Studio, on web (to replace Arial), iOS (to replace Helvetica), and Android (to replace Roboto). We launched Graphik to desktop web last week and have plans to do the same for the native apps; So, some of these changes are now working their way into our web toolkit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I experimented with moving our Android app&apos;s spacing from the Android recommended 16 unit metric base to a 12 unit base to match with web and iOS. (Please note: after attending a Material Design conference at the Google offices and learning about rounding errors I now believe 16 units to be more appropriate for all platforms.)
            </p>


            <h2 class="border_top">Boosting Our Review Rating in the App Store</h2>
            <p>
                Like most apps, our App Store reviews were suffering from negative user complaints. Having conducted many user surveys and hearing only positive comments we suspected that the App Store sentiment did not reflect the average Etsy app user. So a project manager, developer and I set out to change our 2-3 star review rating.
            </p>
            <p> 
                We created a popup that shows only after positive experiences &ndash; like after a purchase or after an item has shipped. The popup asks the buyer what they think of the Etsy app. If they like it, we ask them to review the app and direct them to the App Store. If they say they are unsatisfied, we ask them how we could improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project took just 30 minutes to design and only 2 days to develop, yet  overnight we had hundreds of new, positive reviews. We continue to show this popup a day or two after each release. Doing so has improved our overall rating to 4 stars, and diverted negative feedback from the App Store directly to Etsy – where we can use the feedback to make improvements.
            </p>

            <h2 class="border_top">Apple Watch</h2>
            <p>
               I remember working on iOS apps when the App Store was still fairly empty; it gave my clients easy discoverability. Not only was a new device class from Apple too attractive to ignore but the prospect of a nearly empty launch day App Store section made creating an app for the soon to be launched Apple Watch a no-brainier. When I noticed Mike, a crackerjack iOS developer, experimenting with the pre-release SDK, I knew I had a partner! I created naive (but good-enough) mockups that night and we commisioned a 3D-printed Apple Watch so that we could feel out the new device without actually having access to one.
            </p>
            <div class="portfolio_image_container">
                <%= image_tag_with_at2x "/images/portfolio/apple_watch_3d_print.jpg", alt: "Word" %>
                <div class="caption">

            </div>
            <p>
                Mike and I became serious about using the SDK, and with the help of a project manager started to flesh out the app and notifications. Arpan, our group&apos;s director, called our Apple rep who invited Mike and me out to Cupertino to work with protoype watches. For the two weeks we worked alongside Apple designers and developers to craft our app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once at Apple and testing our work on real devices, several things became obvious. First, Glances seemed like an important way to get users to launch our app. But it also seemed to have limited layout capabilities causing, me to redesign our Glances several times. Also, we realized that animations than ran well in the simulator caused real Apple Watches to choke. We modified our designs to fit the constraints. No question, working with real hardware and software &ndash; no matter how buggy &ndash; was invaluable.

                Etsy for Apple Watch was launched the same day that the App Store made watch extensions available. Both our watch app and our universal buyer app were featured that day and for many weeks following. Subsequently, Apple displayed the Etsy logo during consecutive Apple Watch related announcements, and internally the watch was touted to our investors as a sign that Etsy actively cared about emerging technology.

            <h2 class="border_top">Etsy for Apple TV</h2>
            <p>
                After the marketing success of our Apple Watch I've been eager to create an Apple TV app for Etsy. This is a challenge because the current internal Etsy teams structure promotes creating cross-platform products, but does not account for new platforms like the TV. Also, after the latest Apple keynote &ndash; where Apple showed an early prototype of a Gilt Group shopping app &ndash; it does seem as though Apple believes the TV will become a significant e-commerce platform. It's up to me to gather support for the project.

                Knowing this I&apos;ve already created mockups for the project, and I&apos;m actively generating buzz around the office. Once we have a small team in place we'll be able to experiment in live code and adjust the app accordingly. I have high hopes :)
