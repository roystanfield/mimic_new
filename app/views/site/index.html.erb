         After a <%= link_to "co-worker", "https://twitter.com/mjmacdougall" %> and I became excited about the device's impending release our 3-person team set to work developing <%= link_to "Etsy for Apple Watch", "#" %>. <!--Proudly, our little Etsy app extension has been an App Store staple since day one.--> It enables notifications, package tracking, Handoff back to the iPhone app and a recommended items feed for Etsy buyers.

          In 2014 I designed Etsy&apos;s second native app, <%= link_to "Sell on Etsy", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sell-on-etsy/id860815329?mt=8", class: "no_wrap" %>, which launched in six countries. Building on top of that foundation my team and I launched a card reader for both Android and iOS devices that helps sellers make in-person cash and credit card sales. Unlike a Square reader, it is powerfully integrated with an Etsy seller&apos;s shop inventory. Fred Wilson writes about it <%= link_to "here", "http://avc.com/2014/10/feature-friday-etsy-in-real-life/" %>.

          Before Etsy I worked at Mixel, building fun apps for creating, sharing and remixing collages. While there I created designs for the iPad, iPhone and web. On the web side, I implemented my work using Ruby on Rails, Javascript and CSS. <%= link_to "Mixel was acquired by Etsy", "http://allthingsd.com/20130122/etsy-acquires-mixel-for-mobile-team/" %> in January 2013.

          My mornings are spent jogging to work while wearing a nerdsack. I usually follow this up with an hour of extracurricular iOS programming.
